# Keyword Clustering using TF-IDF and K-Means

This project performs clustering of text data (keywords) using TF-IDF for feature extraction, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means for clustering. The pipeline includes preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and cluster analysis.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and basic text cleaning
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts keywords to numerical features
- **Manual PCA Implementation**: Dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis
- **K-Means Clustering**: Custom implementation with k-means++ initialization
- **Cluster Analysis**: Visualizations and keyword frequency analysis
- **Elbow Method**: For determining optimal number of clusters

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages:
